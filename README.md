I'm currently working on [GTDPad](https://github.com/markashleybell/gtdpad2), which is helping me bring my front-end skills up to date.

Here are a couple of recent blog posts:

- [Local GitHub repository backups with Python](https://markb.uk/local-github-repository-backup-with-python.html)
- [Handling errors with specific error types and C# pattern matching](https://markb.uk/csharp-pattern-matching-with-specific-error-types.html)

My next project will be to automate this README!
